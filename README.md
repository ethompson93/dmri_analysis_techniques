# Analysis Techniques for Diffusion MRI ðŸ§ 
### Materials for ISMRM workshop on 40 years of diffusion MRI
### ðŸŽ“ Educational Bootcamp, 16th Feb 2025, Kyoto
**Ellie Thompson and Anna Schroder, UCL Hawkes Institute**


## ðŸ“‚ Data
The data you will need for the practicals is included in the [data](https://github.com/ethompson93/dmri_analysis_techniques/tree/main/data) folder. We will be using the [Fibercup phantom](https://tractometer.org/fibercup/home/) for all the practicals.

## Exercise 1 - The Diffusion Tensor
[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/ethompson93/dmri_analysis_techniques/blob/main/DTI_Estimation.ipynb)

In this exercise we fit the diffusion tensor model to phantom data using non-linear least squares. You will code up the model from scratch and visualise the results.

## Exercise 2 - Ball and Stick Model
[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/ethompson93/dmri_analysis_techniques/blob/main/ball_and_stick.ipynb)

In this exercise we fit a simple compartment model: the ball-and-stick model. As in the previous exercise, you will code the model from scratch and fit it to the data using non-linear least squares.

## Exercise 3 - Constrained Spherical Deconvolution
[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/ethompson93/dmri_analysis_techniques/blob/main/constrained_spherical_deconvolution.ipynb)

In this exercise we will use tools from [DIPY](https://dipy.org) to obtain the voxel-wise fibre orientation function by performing constrained spherical deconvolution on our dataset. The practical draws on the example from the DIPY workshop: [Reconstruction with Constrained Spherical Deconvolution](https://workshop.dipy.org/documentation/1.6.0./examples_built/reconst_csd/).
